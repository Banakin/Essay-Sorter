Astronaut Survives 9.5 Months with No Pizza


Even though astronaut Peggy Whitson slept in the cramped quarters of the International Space Station for more than 250 nights, she still describes* the station as an "awe-inspiring creation" from which one can see an "enchantingly peaceful" view of the planet Earth.  

Peggy, a flight engineer who now holds the world record for longest time spent in orbit, used a special exercise machine to keep her bones and muscles strong during her 9.5 months in zero gravity.  She credits this machine with keeping her healthy during the long-duration mission which she hopes will inspire others to break more records in the future.  

While her achievement required extraordinary levels of focus and hard work, Peggy remains humble about setting a new world record.  In an interview with the Associated Press, Peggy praised her crewmates and the many people back on Earth who make space flight possible.  Unable to return to their homes at night because of Hurricane Harvey, the dedicated members of the mission control team slept on cots next to their desks in order to keep the mission safe and error-free.

Having completed her third long-duration voyage on the International Space Station, Peggy "still canâ€™t believe the incredible level of detail that was required to imagine this place, let alone to build it!"
