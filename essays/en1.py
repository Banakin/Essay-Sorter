essay_en1 = """I Think Astronauts are Cool


WOW!  Are you ready for space?!!!  The International Space Station is a thing WAY away from planet Earth where people can be in outer space.  It is really really really cool and ostentatious.  It is not REALLY that new but I am not sure when it was made.  Probably it was made myriad months before I was born.

This week is important because one astronaut who was on the International Space Station for a long long long time is flying back to Earth.  Her name is Peggy Whitson.  Peggy is an engineer and she is very experienced in space flight.  She broke a world record during this trip to the space station because she stayed there for more than 9 months!  Can you imagine?!!!  I can.  It is INCREDIBLY hard to live in space for a long time.  She is a champion of outer space.  I like champions.  My PE teacher in the third grade said we are all champions.  

The International Space Station is really fast.  It goes at 17,500 mph which is faster than almost anything we drive on Earth.  Except in my dreams!  In my dreams I fly faster than a thousand speedy bullets.  But why bullets?  We are talking about space and there are not bullets in space, right?  Right.  My aunt Sumayah drives a convertible because she started a big software company and got paid a lot of money.  Even Sumayah's convertible can't go at 17,500 mph!  But I bet her dreams can.  REALLY.

There were two other astronauts on the space station with Peggy during her mission.  Astronauts on the space station are kind of like a family because they live together, work together, and eat meals together.  I like family.  And pigs. And space.  Whoa, do you?  

The astronauts are very lucky to get to live in such a cool place.  So this week is really important because it's about space and speed and family and love and love is great.
